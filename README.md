## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I haven't made a frontend web project in a few months, so it was very interesting finding my way back to web programming. I'm very proud of myself and how fast I actually finished this project.


### Continued development

I want to try and better my accessibility on this project and also how to write a bit less CSS code that is effective.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - His channel helped me out so much with getting back to CSS. It was a blast

## Acknowledgments

I have gotten my inspiration to start this project from Kevin Powell on Youtube. His solution was incredible but I tried to do my own custom CSS and not copy his work. My goal was to try things myself with little help from anyone, except my own knowledge.
